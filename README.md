The project contains 3 files index.html, style.css, script.css. This is a simple number guessing game, the number will be ranging from 1 to 100, and you will have 10 tries to guess it right.

HOW TO RUN:
Its very simple to run it, just run the index.html on the browser.

The main work done in the project is in javascript file i.e. script.js, which keeps track of the remaining number of guesses, previous guesses, when to end the game and start a new game again with the default values.

Thanks to Chai aur Code YT.
